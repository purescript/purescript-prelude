-- THE REPR TYPE & CONSTRUCTORS -----------------------------------------------

-- | A debugging representation of some PureScript value. It is often possible
-- | to reconstruct the original value from this representation, but not
-- | always; notable counterexamples are `Effect`, `Ref`, and `(->)`.
newtype Repr = Repr (Tree Label)

derive newtype instance eqRepr :: Eq Repr
derive newtype instance ordRepr :: Ord Repr

unRepr :: Repr -> Tree Label
unRepr (Repr tree) = tree

-- | Labels for a tree which encodes a debugging representation of some
-- | PureScript value.
data Label
  -- Note that Repr trees are not correct-by-construction by default; whether
  -- or not children are permitted at a given node depends on the constructor
  -- of the label. We do however use newtypes, and we avoid exporting
  -- constructors in favour of specialised construction functions, in order to
  -- ensure that all trees constructed by the exposed API are guaranteed to
  -- be valid.

  -- These labels should always be leaves, and should only ever be used to
  -- represent the Prim types they contain.
  = Int Int
  | Number Number
  | Boolean Boolean
  | Char Char
  | String String

  -- This label represents a value of the type `Prim.Array`. Its children
  -- should be the contents of the array.
  | Array

  -- This label represents a value of the type `Prim.Record`. Its immediate
  -- children should all have Prop labels.
  | Record

  -- This node represents a property with the given name. It should only occur
  -- as a direct descendent of a Record- or Opaque-labelled node.  A node
  -- with this label should always have exactly one child: the property value.
  | Prop String

  -- Function application; mostly intended for use with data constructors.
  -- Children of nodes with this label represent the arguments to the
  -- function/data constructor.
  | App String

  -- These constructors are for representations of opaque data types, or data
  -- types where this representation is more helpful than the 'obvious'
  -- representation (e.g. List).

  -- This constructor represents an opaque data type such as `(->)` or `Ref`.
  -- The argument should contain the name of the data type. Nodes with this
  -- label may have a number of Prop labels as immediate children, or
  -- alternatively a single Literal label.
  | Opaque String

  -- This constructor should only ever appear as an immediate child of an
  -- `Opaque` constructor, and should always be a leaf node. It is useful for
  -- types which have an obvious representation which doesn't fit into any of
  -- the other options for constructing Repr values. For example, dates or
  -- times may want to use this constructor in order to display as e.g. <Date:
  -- 2019-02-01> or <Time: 12:00? respectively.
  | Literal String

  -- This constructor is for map-like collections. The children are the
  -- contents; every direct child should have an AssocProp label.
  | Assoc String

  -- This constructor is for the key-value pairs of map-like collections. Each
  -- node with this label should have exactly two children: the key and the
  -- value.
  | AssocProp

  -- This constructor is only used for pretty-printing, where we have cut the
  -- tree off after a certain depth.
