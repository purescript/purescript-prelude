-- | The `EuclideanRing` class is for commutative rings that support division.
-- | The mathematical structure this class is based on is sometimes also called
-- | a *Euclidean domain*.
-- |
-- | Instances must satisfy the following laws in addition to the `Ring`
-- | laws:
-- |
-- | - Integral domain: `one /= zero`, and if `a` and `b` are both nonzero then
-- |   so is their product `a * b`
-- | - Euclidean function `degree`:
-- |   - Nonnegativity: For all nonzero `a`, `degree a >= 0`
-- |   - Quotient/remainder: For all `a` and `b`, where `b` is nonzero,
-- |     let `q = a / b` and ``r = a `mod` b``; then `a = q*b + r`, and also
-- |     either `r = zero` or `degree r < degree b`
-- | - Submultiplicative euclidean function:
-- |   - For all nonzero `a` and `b`, `degree a <= degree (a * b)`
-- |
-- | The behaviour of division by `zero` is unconstrained by these laws,
-- | meaning that individual instances are free to choose how to behave in this
-- | case. Similarly, there are no restrictions on what the result of
-- | `degree zero` is; it doesn't make sense to ask for `degree zero` in the
-- | same way that it doesn't make sense to divide by `zero`, so again,
-- | individual instances may choose how to handle this case.
-- |
-- | For any `EuclideanRing` which is also a `Field`, one valid choice
-- | for `degree` is simply `const 1`. In fact, unless there's a specific
-- | reason not to, `Field` types should normally use this definition of
-- | `degree`.
-- |
-- | The `Unit` instance is provided for backwards compatibility, but it is
-- | not law-abiding, because `Unit` fails to form an integral domain. This
-- | instance will be removed in a future release.
